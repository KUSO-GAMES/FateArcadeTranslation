Translation Tracker ver 00.01 by NOGAMES
Some translation by NOGAMES

WARNING: Always back up your old files before replacing them with the translated files.
WARNING: These have not yet been QCed for 'fit' within the text boundaries.
WARNING: I have not made enough progress to validate translation additions in-game yet.
User experience may vary. Added translations contributed through mixed methods (legacy FGO mobile, prior knowledge) and machine translation.

Just replace all files with those found in rom folder in appropriate directories.
The directory titled 'new (for reference only)' contains the files changed in this version and does not need to be added to the game files.

Credits to Haruka Akechi for tools used to unpack/repack files and for initial translation across various files.



***************


Began organizing and codifying translation status for various files.
Version 00.01 - mst_data, single, and talk_list are the only fully populated tabs. Work will begin on populating the sprite tab next.

/rom/mst_data

Assessment:
'arms_mst_collaborator.farc' is being marked to skip for translation in the tracker as these are all the CVs and artists credited on the cards


***************


/rom/single/

Revision:
Added initial translation to all missing 'spot_name' in 'single/spot_prop.txt' (Starting from spot_name62)
Added initial translation to all missing 'active_spot_info' in 'single/spot_prop.txt' (KnK collab missions)

Initial translation:
Added initial translation to various 'single/mission_prop_xxxx.txt' mission 1 objecives. (For TL ver.00.01: mission_prop_0001 mission_prop_0004 and mission_prop_0010)


***************


/rom/sprite
Began initial image unpacking and editing for various sprites.
*NOTE: These are naturally the equivalents of 'hard subs' and take a great deal more work.
*NOTE: These are individually unpacked in various .DDS files as groups of sprites, edited one by one and repacked.
*NOTE: Some sprites may be skipped from translation within packs at this time. 


These will be uploaded in translation 00.02 with more details on what's changing.
